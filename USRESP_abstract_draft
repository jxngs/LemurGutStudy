This research explores lemur gut microbiome patterns across days and seasons, 
addressing questions of variation and influential predictors. Despite non-independent 
observations, a robust linear mixed effects model is employed, treating individual 
lemur identity as a random effect. Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests reveal stationary 
microbiome patterns within and between days. Group correlation analyses highlight 
significant intraclass correlation for Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity. A nested 
linear mixed model investigates fixed effects of species, time of day, and season, 
with interaction terms. The study aims to discern associations between these 
factors and lemur gut microbiome patterns. Chi-square difference tests assess 
model improvements, providing a comprehensive analysis of the complex interplay 
of biological and environmental factors influencing lemur gut microbiomes.
